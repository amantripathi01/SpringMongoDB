```
Scenario 1: Return Null When Techs Array is Null

Details:
  TestName: returnNullWhenTechsArrayIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getTechs() method when the techs array is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Post class and set the techs field to null.
  Act: Invoke the getTechs() method on the Post instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getTechs() method correctly handles the case where the techs array is null. This ensures that the method does not throw a NullPointerException or return an unexpected value when the underlying data is null. This test is essential for ensuring the robustness of the method and handling edge cases gracefully.

Scenario 2: Return Empty Array When Techs Array is Empty

Details:
  TestName: returnEmptyArrayWhenTechsArrayIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getTechs() method when the techs array is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Post class and set the techs field to an empty array.
  Act: Invoke the getTechs() method on the Post instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is not null and has a length of 0.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getTechs() method correctly handles the case where the techs array is empty. It ensures that the method does not return null when the underlying data is an empty array. This test is crucial for ensuring the method's correctness and handling edge cases appropriately.

Scenario 3: Return Correct Array When Techs Array is Populated

Details:
  TestName: returnCorrectArrayWhenTechsArrayIsPopulated
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getTechs() method when the techs array is populated with values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Post class and set the techs field to an array with some values (e.g., ["Java", "Python", "JavaScript"]).
  Act: Invoke the getTechs() method on the Post instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is not null, has the correct length, and contains the expected values in the correct order.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getTechs() method correctly returns the techs array when it is populated with values. This test ensures that the method accurately retrieves the underlying data and does not modify or alter it in any way. It is essential for validating the core functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Return Same Reference When getTechs is Called Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: returnSameReferenceWhenGetTechsIsCalledMultipleTimes
  Description: This test checks if the getTechs() method returns the same reference to the techs array when called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Post class and set the techs field to an array with some values.
  Act: Invoke the getTechs() method multiple times and store the returned references in separate variables.
  Assert: Verify that all the returned references are the same (i.e., pointing to the same array object).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getTechs() method does not create a new array instance each time it is called. Instead, it should return the same reference to the underlying techs array. This test ensures that the method's behavior is consistent and does not inadvertently create new objects, which could lead to memory leaks or performance issues in certain scenarios.

```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the getTechs() method, including handling null and empty arrays, verifying the correctness of the returned array, and ensuring consistent behavior when called multiple times. By executing these tests, you can gain confidence in the functionality of the getTechs() method and identify any potential issues or edge cases that need to be addressed.
