"""
  Scenario 1: Positive Test scenario to check proper assignment of profile to a non-null String value.

  Details:
    TestName: assignValidStringToProfile.
    Description: This test is designed to check the method setProfile when passed a valid non-null String.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A non-null String, say "Java Developer", is prepared for the profile.
    Act: The method setProfile is called with the String "Java Developer".
    Assert: JUnit is used to assert that the profile has the value "Java Developer".
  Validation:
    This assertion ensures that the method setProfile correctly assigns the value "Java Developer" to the profile. It verifies that a non-null String assignment works as expected on this method.

  Scenario 2: Negative scenario to check proper handling of null value assignment.

  Details:
    TestName: assignNullToProfile.
    Description: This test checks for the method performance when a null string is passed as a profile value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A null string is prepared as a profile.
    Act: The method setProfile is invoked with the null string.
    Assert: JUnit is used to check that profile is null.
  Validation:
    This checks that the setProfile method can handle null string assignments. It verifies that null assignments do not cause exceptions and are handled as expected.

  Scenario 3: Edge case scenario where an empty string is assigned to the profile.

  Details:
    TestName: assignEmptyStringToProfile.
    Description: This test demonstrates the proper execution of setProfile method when passed an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An empty string is prepared as a profile.
    Act: The method setProfile is invoked exposing it to the empty string.
    Assert: JUnit is used to assert that profile equals to empty string.
  Validation:
    It verifies the method's execution in this edge-case scenario helps to confirm its consistent behaviour even when empty strings are assigned as profile.

  Scenario 4: Scenario to check the maximum char limit for string profile.

  Details:
    TestName: assignMaximumCharLimitToProfile.
    Description: This test checks for the maximum char limit that can be assigned to profile string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A string of maximum char limit is prepared for profile.
    Act: The method setProfile is called with this string.
    Assert: JUnit is used to ascertain that the string profile is equal to the prepared string.
  Validation:
    This scenario is significant for ensuring that the method setProfile effectively handles and sets maximum char limit strings to profile. It verifies that boundary values are correctly implemented in the method.
