"""
  Scenario 1: Validate that techs array is correctly setting
  Details:
    TestName: setTechsSuccessfully
    Description: This test aims to verify that the setTechs method is able to successfully set the techs array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array of techs: {"Java", "Python", "JavaScript"}.
    Act: Invoke setTechs with the created array.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the techs array in the class is equal to the input array.
  Validation:
    This test checks if the techs field has been successfully updated with the correct values. In this scenario, the setTechs method is expected to correctly store the array. If the test fails, then we have a problem with the storage of the techs array.

  Scenario 2: Validate setTechs with null array
  Details:
    TestName: setTechsWithNullArray
    Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setTechs method when passing null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input array as null.
    Act: Invoke the setTechs method with null array.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the techs array in the class is null.
  Validation:
    This test checks if the setTechs method can handle null input properly. The method should be able to handle null values without throwing exceptions and store null in the class array.

  Scenario 3: Validate setTechs with an empty array
  Details:
    TestName: setTechsWithEmptyArray
    Description: This test verifies the behavior of setTechs method when passing an empty array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input array as empty.
    Act: Invoke setTechs method with empty array.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the techs array in the class is empty.
  Validation:
    This test checks if the setTechs method can handle empty input array properly. The method should be able to handle empty values without throwing exceptions and store an empty array in the class array.

  Scenario 4: Validate the techs array length after setTechs operation
  Details:
    TestName: validateTechsArrayLengthAfterSetTechs
    Description: This test verifies whether the length of the techs array is consistent with the length of the input array after a setTechs operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array of techs: {"Java", "Python", "JavaScript"}.
    Act: Invoke the setTechs method with the created array.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the length of the techs array in the class is equal to the length of the input array.
  Validation:
    This test checks if the setTechs method maintains the length consistency between input and stored array. If the lengths mismatch, it indicates a problem with the method implementation.
