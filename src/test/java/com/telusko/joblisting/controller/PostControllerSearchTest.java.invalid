```
Scenario 1: Search for existing text

Details:
  TestName: searchExistingText
  Description: This test verifies that the search method correctly returns a list of Post objects when the provided text matches the text of one or more posts in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock SearchRepository with a list of Post objects containing at least one Post with text matching the test input.
    Act: Invoke the search method with the test input text.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list is not null and contains the expected Post objects.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the search method accurately retrieves and returns Post objects based on the provided text. This test validates the core functionality of the search method and ensures that it can handle successful search scenarios.

Scenario 2: Search for non-existing text

Details:
  TestName: searchNonExistingText
  Description: This test verifies that the search method returns an empty list when the provided text does not match any Post objects in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock SearchRepository with a list of Post objects that do not contain any Post with text matching the test input.
    Act: Invoke the search method with the test input text.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list is not null and is empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the search method correctly handles scenarios where the provided text does not match any Post objects. This test verifies that the method does not return incorrect or null results when no matches are found.

Scenario 3: Search with null or empty text

Details:
  TestName: searchNullOrEmptyText
  Description: This test verifies that the search method handles null or empty text inputs gracefully and returns an appropriate result.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock SearchRepository with a list of Post objects.
    Act: Invoke the search method with null and empty string as input text separately.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list is not null and is either empty or contains all Post objects, depending on the desired behavior.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the search method handles null or empty text inputs correctly. This test validates the method's robustness and error handling capabilities when dealing with invalid or edge-case inputs.

Scenario 4: Search with case-insensitive text

Details:
  TestName: searchCaseInsensitiveText
  Description: This test verifies that the search method performs case-insensitive text matching when searching for Post objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock SearchRepository with a list of Post objects containing at least one Post with text matching the test input in a different case.
    Act: Invoke the search method with the test input text in a different case than the Post text.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list is not null and contains the expected Post objects, regardless of the case.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the search method correctly handles case-insensitive text matching. This test validates the method's ability to retrieve Post objects based on text content, ignoring case differences.

Scenario 5: Search with special characters and whitespace

Details:
  TestName: searchWithSpecialCharactersAndWhitespace
  Description: This test verifies that the search method correctly handles text input containing special characters and whitespace when searching for Post objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock SearchRepository with a list of Post objects containing at least one Post with text matching the test input, including special characters and whitespace.
    Act: Invoke the search method with the test input text containing special characters and whitespace.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list is not null and contains the expected Post objects, including those with special characters and whitespace in their text.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the search method correctly handles text input with special characters and whitespace. This test validates the method's robustness in dealing with various types of text inputs and its ability to match Post objects accurately.

```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the search method, including successful searches, edge cases (null or empty input), case-insensitive matching, and handling special characters and whitespace. By implementing these tests, you can ensure that the search method functions correctly and handles different input scenarios as expected.
