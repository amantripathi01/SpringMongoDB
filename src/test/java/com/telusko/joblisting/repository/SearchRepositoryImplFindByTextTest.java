"""
Scenario 1: Verify that method returns expected list of posts when valid text is provided

Details:
    TestName: testFindTextValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the defined method findByText is able to find the text in the provided database and returns the expected list of posts.

Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the MongoClient, MongoDatabase, MongoCollection and MongoConverter to return predefined outputs for getClient, getDatabase, getCollection and read respectively.
    Act: Invoke the findByText method with a valid string.
    Assert: Check that returned list of posts matches the expected posts.

Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the expected list of posts when a valid string is provided. Proper functioning of this method is crucial for the application to deliver correct search results.

Scenario 2: Verify that method correctly handles an empty database

Details:
    TestName: testFindTextEmptyDatabase
    Description: This test will verify if the method handles empty database i.e., if it returns an empty list when there are no posts to find.

Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the MongoClient and MongoDatabase to return an empty database.
    Act: Invoke findByText method.
    Assert: Check that the returned list is empty.

Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty database. In real scenarios, it will help to check if the application is able to deal with situations when the database is empty.

Scenario 3: Test incorrect/invalid database

Details:
    TestName: testFindTextInvalidDatabase
    Description: This test is to check if the method handles an invalid/non-existent database correctly.

Execution:
    Arrange: Mock MongoClient to return a non-existing database.
    Act: Invoke findByText method.
    Assert: Expected exception (for example, a DatabaseNotFoundException).

Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the method can handle a situation where the intended database does not exist. In practical terms, this scenario is important for proactive error handling in the application.

Scenario 4: Test the case where the method is given a null as an input.

Details:
    TestName: testFindTextNullInput.
    Description: This test checks the method's behavior when a null input is given.

Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange step necessary for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke findByText with null.
    Assert: Method should handle the null by returning an empty list or throwing an appropriate exception.

Validation:
   The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle null inputs appropriately. This is important to ensure robustness against erroneous or unexpected input.
