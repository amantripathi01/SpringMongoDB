Scenario 1: Verify that the Docket object is created with the correct configuration

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreation
  Description: This test ensures that the `api` method creates a Docket object with the desired configuration for Swagger 2 documentation. It checks if the Docket object is correctly set up with the specified DocumentationType, RequestHandlerSelectors, PathSelectors, ApiInfo, and response message handling.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket object has the expected properties set.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket object is correctly configured to generate Swagger 2 documentation for the API. This is crucial for providing accurate and comprehensive documentation for the application's REST endpoints, making it easier for developers and consumers to understand and interact with the API. The test ensures that the configuration matches the desired settings, such as including only controllers annotated with `@RestController`, including all paths, and using the provided ApiInfo object.

Scenario 2: Ensure that the ApiInfo object is correctly built

Details:
  TestName: verifyApiInfoBuilding
  Description: This test verifies that the `apiInfo` method correctly builds and returns an ApiInfo object. It checks if the ApiInfo object is created with the desired properties and configurations.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the `apiInfo` method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ApiInfo object has the expected properties set.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the ApiInfo object, which provides metadata about the API, is correctly built. The ApiInfo object is an essential component of the Swagger 2 documentation and is used to display information such as the API title, description, version, and contact details. This test verifies that the ApiInfo object is correctly constructed according to the application's requirements, ensuring that the generated Swagger documentation accurately represents the API.

Scenario 3: Verify the behavior when no @RestController classes are present

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithNoRestControllers
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when there are no classes annotated with `@RestController` in the application. It checks if the Docket object is still created correctly, even when no REST controllers are present.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock or simulate an environment where no classes are annotated with `@RestController`.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket object is not null and has the expected properties set, but with an empty set of REST controllers.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method handles the scenario where no REST controllers are present in the application. While it is unlikely in a real-world scenario, this test verifies that the method does not fail or throw an exception when no controllers are found. It checks if the Docket object is still created correctly, albeit with an empty set of REST controllers. This test helps catch potential issues or edge cases related to the handling of empty controller sets, ensuring the robustness of the method.

Scenario 4: Verify the behavior when an invalid DocumentationType is provided

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithInvalidDocumentationType
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when an invalid or unsupported DocumentationType is provided. It checks if the method handles the invalid input gracefully and returns a valid Docket object or throws an appropriate exception.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an invalid or unsupported DocumentationType value.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method with the invalid DocumentationType.
  Assert: Verify that the method either returns a valid Docket object with default or fallback configurations, or throws an expected exception.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method handles invalid or unsupported DocumentationTypes correctly. Swagger supports various documentation types, but there may be scenarios where an invalid or unsupported value is provided (e.g., due to user input or configuration errors). This test verifies that the method either gracefully handles the invalid input by returning a valid Docket object with default or fallback configurations, or throws an appropriate exception to indicate the invalid input. This test helps catch potential issues or edge cases related to input validation and error handling, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the method.

Scenario 5: Verify the behavior when an invalid ApiInfo object is provided

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithInvalidApiInfo
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when an invalid or null ApiInfo object is provided. It checks if the method handles the invalid input gracefully and returns a valid Docket object or throws an appropriate exception.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an invalid or null ApiInfo object.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method with the invalid ApiInfo object.
  Assert: Verify that the method either returns a valid Docket object with default or fallback configurations for ApiInfo, or throws an expected exception.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method handles invalid or null ApiInfo objects correctly. The ApiInfo object is an essential component of the Swagger documentation and provides metadata about the API. This test verifies that the method either gracefully handles the invalid input by using default or fallback configurations for the ApiInfo object, or throws an appropriate exception to indicate the invalid input. This test helps catch potential issues or edge cases related to input validation and error handling, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the method.

Scenario 6: Verify the behavior when PathSelectors or RequestHandlerSelectors are modified

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithModifiedSelectors
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when the PathSelectors or RequestHandlerSelectors are modified or customized. It checks if the Docket object is created correctly with the modified selector configurations.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare modified or customized PathSelectors and RequestHandlerSelectors.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method with the modified selectors.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket object has the expected properties set, including the modified selector configurations.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method correctly handles and applies modifications to the PathSelectors and RequestHandlerSelectors. These selectors control which paths and controllers are included in the Swagger documentation. This test verifies that the method can accommodate customizations or modifications to these selectors, ensuring that the generated Swagger documentation accurately reflects the desired paths and controllers. This test is essential for verifying the flexibility and extensibility of the method, allowing developers to tailor the Swagger documentation to their specific needs.

Scenario 7: Verify the behavior when useDefaultResponseMessages is set to true

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithDefaultResponseMessages
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag is set to `true`. It checks if the Docket object is created correctly with the default response messages enabled.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method with `useDefaultResponseMessages` set to `true`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket object has the expected properties set, including the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag set to `true`.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method correctly handles the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag when set to `true`. The `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag controls whether the Swagger documentation should include default response messages (e.g., HTTP status codes and their descriptions) or not. This test verifies that when the flag is set to `true`, the generated Swagger documentation includes the default response messages, providing additional information and context to API consumers. This test helps ensure the correctness of the Swagger documentation generation based on the specified configuration.

Scenario 8: Verify the behavior when useDefaultResponseMessages is set to false

Details:
  TestName: verifyDocketCreationWithoutDefaultResponseMessages
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `api` method when the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag is set to `false`. It checks if the Docket object is created correctly without including the default response messages.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the `api` method with `useDefaultResponseMessages` set to `false`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket object has the expected properties set, including the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag set to `false`.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the `api` method correctly handles the `useDefaultResponseMessages` flag when set to `false`. When the flag is set to `false`, the generated Swagger documentation should not include the default response messages (e.g., HTTP status codes and their descriptions). This test verifies that the Swagger documentation is generated without the default response messages, providing a more concise and focused documentation for API consumers. This test helps ensure the correctness of the Swagger documentation generation based on the specified configuration.
