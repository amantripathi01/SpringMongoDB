```plaintext
Scenario 1: Verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured with Swagger 2 documentation type.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanConfiguredWithSwagger2
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is correctly configured to use Swagger 2 as the documentation type. The test ensures that the Docket instance returned by the `api()` method is set up with the correct documentation type.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `getDocumentationType()` method of the Docket instance returns `DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2`.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured to use Swagger 2. This is significant because the correct documentation type is essential for generating the appropriate API documentation.

---

Scenario 2: Verify that the Docket bean is configured to select APIs with the RestController annotation.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanSelectsApisWithRestControllerAnnotation
  Description: This test ensures that the Docket bean is configured to select only those APIs that are annotated with the `@RestController` annotation. This is crucial for ensuring that only the relevant controllers are included in the Swagger documentation.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `apis()` method of the Docket instance is configured with `RequestHandlerSelectors.withClassAnnotation(RestController.class)`.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured to select APIs with the `@RestController` annotation. This is significant because it ensures that only the relevant controllers are included in the Swagger documentation, avoiding unnecessary clutter.

---

Scenario 3: Verify that the Docket bean is configured to allow any path for API documentation.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanAllowsAnyPath
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is configured to allow any path for API documentation. This ensures that all endpoints, regardless of their path, are included in the Swagger documentation.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `paths()` method of the Docket instance is configured with `PathSelectors.any()`.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured to allow any path for API documentation. This is significant because it ensures that all endpoints are included in the Swagger documentation, providing comprehensive API documentation.

---

Scenario 4: Verify that the Docket bean is configured with custom API info.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanConfiguredWithCustomApiInfo
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is configured with custom API info. The test ensures that the `apiInfo()` method is called and that the Docket instance is built with the custom API info.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `apiInfo()` method is called and that the Docket instance is built with the custom API info.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured with custom API info. This is significant because custom API info provides additional details about the API, such as its title, description, and version, which are important for API consumers.

---

Scenario 5: Verify that the Docket bean is configured to use default response messages.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanConfiguredWithoutDefaultResponseMessages
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is configured to not use default response messages. The test ensures that the `useDefaultResponseMessages(false)` method is called, which disables the default response messages in the Swagger documentation.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `useDefaultResponseMessages(false)` method is called on the Docket instance.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured to not use default response messages. This is significant because disabling default response messages allows for custom response messages, which can provide more accurate and relevant information to API consumers.

---

Scenario 6: Verify that the Docket bean is correctly built and returned.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanCorrectlyBuiltAndReturned
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is correctly built and returned by the `api()` method. The test ensures that the returned Docket instance is not null and is an instance of the Docket class.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Docket instance is not null and is an instance of the Docket class.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly built and returned. This is significant because a correctly built and returned Docket instance is essential for generating accurate and complete Swagger documentation.

---

Scenario 7: Verify that the Docket bean is configured with the correct API info builder.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanConfiguredWithCorrectApiInfoBuilder
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is configured with the correct API info builder. The test ensures that the `apiInfo()` method is called and that the Docket instance is built with the correct API info builder.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `apiInfo()` method is called and that the Docket instance is built with the correct API info builder.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured with the correct API info builder. This is significant because the API info builder is responsible for constructing the API info, which provides important details about the API.

---

Scenario 8: Verify that the Docket bean is configured to exclude default response messages.

Details:  
  TestName: docketBeanExcludesDefaultResponseMessages
  Description: This test checks if the Docket bean is configured to exclude default response messages. The test ensures that the `useDefaultResponseMessages(false)` method is called, which excludes default response messages from the Swagger documentation.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the method does not depend on external data or mocks.
  Act: Invoke the `api()` method to get the Docket instance.
  Assert: Verify that the `useDefaultResponseMessages(false)` method is called on the Docket instance.
  
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Docket bean is correctly configured to exclude default response messages. This is significant because excluding default response messages allows for custom response messages, which can provide more accurate and relevant information to API consumers.
