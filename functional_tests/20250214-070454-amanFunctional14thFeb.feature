Feature: Testing Jira Integration and AI Model Testing Platform

# Functional Tests

Scenario: Create a new Jira ticket and trigger a test
  Given a valid license key
  And a unique Jira ticket ID
  And a valid Jira host name
  And valid AI model information
  And valid integration information
  When I send a POST request to "/create-ticket" with the required payload
  Then the response status should be 201 (Created)
  And the response should contain the "test_id"
  And a new Jira ticket should be created with the provided details

Scenario: Retrieve test execution results
  Given a valid test ID from a previously triggered test
  When I send a GET request to "/test-results/{test_id}"
  Then the response status should be 200 (OK)
  And the response should contain the test execution results

Scenario: Update Jira ticket with test results
  Given a valid Jira ticket ID
  And a completed test execution
  When I send a PUT request to "/update-ticket/{jira_ticket_id}" with the test results payload
  Then the response status should be 200 (OK)
  And the Jira ticket should be updated with the test results

# Non-Functional Tests

Scenario: Stress test the system
  Given a large number of concurrent users
  And a large payload size
  When I send multiple requests to the "/create-ticket" endpoint
  Then the system should handle the load without crashing or degrading performance
  And the response times should be within acceptable limits

Scenario: Test authentication and authorization
  Given an unauthorized user
  When I send a GET request to "/test-results/{test_id}"
  Then the response status should be 401 (Unauthorized)
  And the response should contain an error message

Scenario: Test input validation
  Given malformed or malicious input data
  When I send a POST request to "/create-ticket" with the invalid payload
  Then the response status should be 400 (Bad Request)
  And the response should contain an error message explaining the invalid input

Scenario: Test cross-browser compatibility
  Given a set of popular web browsers
  When I access the application in each browser
  Then the application should render correctly
  And all functionality should work as expected

Scenario: Test failover and recovery
  Given a simulated system failure
  When the system encounters the failure
  Then the system should failover to a redundant component or system
  And the application should continue to function without interruption
