Based on the given user story description, here are the test cases/scenarios covering both functional and non-functional tests:

# Functional Tests

## Test Case 1: Verify Jira Ticket Creation and Test Trigger
- **Description:** Ensure that a new Jira ticket can be created and a test can be triggered successfully.
- **Input Values:**
  - `license_key`: Valid license key
  - `jira_ticket_id`: Unique Jira ticket ID
  - `jira_host_name`: Valid Jira host name
  - `ai_model_info`: Valid AI model information
  - `integration_info`: Valid integration information
  - `create_api_spec`: True/False (optional)
- **Expected Output:** A new Jira ticket should be created, and a test should be triggered successfully. The response should include the `test_id`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test with invalid input values (e.g., empty strings, malformed data)
  - Test with missing required fields
  - Test with large input data to verify handling of large payloads

## Test Case 2: Verify Test Execution and Results
- **Description:** Ensure that the triggered test is executed correctly, and the results are accurate.
- **Input Values:**
  - `test_id`: Valid test ID from the previous test case
- **Expected Output:** The test should be executed successfully, and the results should be available for review.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test with an invalid `test_id`
  - Test with a `test_id` for a failed or incomplete test

## Test Case 3: Verify Jira Ticket Update
- **Description:** Ensure that the Jira ticket is updated with the test results after test execution.
- **Input Values:**
  - `jira_ticket_id`: Valid Jira ticket ID
- **Expected Output:** The Jira ticket should be updated with the test results, including any issues found, comments, and attachments.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test with an invalid `jira_ticket_id`
  - Test with a `jira_ticket_id` for a ticket that does not exist

# Non-Functional Tests

## Performance Testing
- **Description:** Evaluate the system's performance under various load conditions.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Stress Testing: Test the system's behavior under extreme load conditions (e.g., high concurrent users, large payloads)
  - Load Testing: Test the system's performance under different levels of load (e.g., low, medium, high)
  - Scalability Testing: Test the system's ability to scale horizontally or vertically to handle increased load

## Security Testing
- **Description:** Ensure that the system is secure and resistant to various types of attacks.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Authentication and Authorization Testing: Test the system's access control mechanisms
  - Input Validation Testing: Test the system's handling of malicious input data
  - Vulnerability Scanning: Perform automated vulnerability scans to identify potential security vulnerabilities

## Usability Testing
- **Description:** Evaluate the user experience and ease of use of the system.
- **Test Cases:**
  - User Interface Testing: Test the system's user interface for consistency, intuitive design, and accessibility
  - Localization Testing: Test the system's support for different languages and cultural preferences

## Compatibility Testing
- **Description:** Ensure that the system is compatible with different environments and configurations.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Cross-Browser Testing: Test the system's compatibility with various web browsers
  - Cross-Platform Testing: Test the system's compatibility with different operating systems and devices
  - Integration Testing: Test the system's integration with third-party systems and APIs (e.g., Jira, AI models)

## Reliability Testing
- **Description:** Evaluate the system's ability to recover from failures and handle unexpected situations.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Failover Testing: Test the system's ability to failover to redundant components or systems
  - Error Handling Testing: Test the system's handling of various error conditions and exceptions
  - Recovery Testing: Test the system's ability to recover from failures or crashes

Note: The above test cases are general examples, and you may need to tailor them to fit your specific requirements and system architecture.
