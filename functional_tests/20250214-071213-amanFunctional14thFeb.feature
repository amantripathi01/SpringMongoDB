Feature: Jira Ticket Upload and Functional Test Generation

# Functional Tests
Scenario: Verify Jira Ticket Upload
  Given I am on the Functional Testing section
  When I select the option to upload a Jira ticket
  And I choose a valid PDF file containing a Jira ticket
  And I click the "Upload" button
  Then the PDF file should be uploaded successfully
  And the Jira ticket details should be displayed correctly

  Given I am on the Functional Testing section
  When I select the option to upload a Jira ticket
  And I choose a <file_type> PDF file
  And I click the "Upload" button
  Then the system should handle the file <expected_result>

  Examples:
    | file_type | expected_result         |
    | empty     | with an error message   |
    | invalid   | with an error message   |
    | large     | based on file size limit|

Scenario: Verify Jira Ticket Details Extraction
  Given I have uploaded a valid Jira ticket PDF file
  When I view the extracted details
  Then the extracted details should match the information in the uploaded PDF

Scenario Outline: Verify Jira Ticket Details Extraction with Edge Cases
  Given I have uploaded a Jira ticket PDF file with <file_content>
  When I view the extracted details
  Then the extracted details should be displayed correctly

  Examples:
    | file_content       |
    | special characters |
    | non-English text   |
    | different layout   |

Scenario: Verify Functional Test Creation
  Given I have uploaded a valid Jira ticket PDF file
  When I initiate the process to create functional test cases
  Then the generated test cases should accurately reflect the information in the Jira ticket

Scenario Outline: Verify Functional Test Creation with Edge Cases
  Given I have uploaded a Jira ticket PDF file with <ticket_quality>
  When I initiate the process to create functional test cases
  Then the generated test cases should <expected_result>

  Examples:
    | ticket_quality | expected_result                     |
    | complex        | reflect the requirements accurately |
    | insufficient   | have limited test cases             |

# Non-Functional Tests
Scenario: Performance Testing
  Given a high volume of concurrent users
  When they upload Jira ticket PDFs and generate functional tests
  Then the application should maintain acceptable performance and stability

Scenario Outline: Performance Testing with Edge Cases
  Given a high volume of concurrent users uploading <file_type> files
  When they upload Jira ticket PDFs and generate functional tests
  Then the application should maintain acceptable performance and stability

  Examples:
    | file_type |
    | mixed     |
    | valid     |
    | invalid   |

Scenario: Security Testing
  Given a Jira ticket PDF containing sensitive information
  When I upload the PDF file
  Then the sensitive information should not be exposed
  And unauthorized access to the uploaded file should be prevented

Scenario Outline: Security Testing with Edge Cases
  Given a Jira ticket PDF containing <sensitive_data>
  When I upload the PDF file
  Then the sensitive information should not be exposed
  And unauthorized access to the uploaded file should be prevented

  Examples:
    | sensitive_data     |
    | credit card numbers|
    | social security numbers|

Scenario Outline: Usability Testing
  Given a group of <user_type> users
  When they navigate through the process of uploading Jira ticket PDFs and generating functional tests
  Then the user interface and flow should be intuitive and user-friendly

  Examples:
    | user_type       |
    | developers      |
    | testers         |
    | project managers|
    | technically inexperienced|
    | with accessibility needs |
