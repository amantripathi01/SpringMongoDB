   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test with a Jira ticket that contains complex or ambiguous requirements.
     - Test with a Jira ticket that lacks sufficient information for generating test cases.

**Non-Functional Tests:**

1. **Performance Testing**
   - **Description:** Ensure that the application can handle a large number of concurrent requests for uploading Jira tickets and generating functional tests.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - Use a load testing tool (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner) to simulate a high volume of concurrent users uploading Jira ticket PDFs and generating functional tests.
     - Monitor the application's response times, resource utilization, and error rates.
   - **Expected Result:** The application should maintain acceptable performance and stability under high load conditions.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test with a mix of different file sizes and types.
     - Test with a combination of valid and invalid file uploads.

2. **Security Testing**
   - **Description:** Ensure that the application properly handles and protects sensitive information contained in the uploaded Jira ticket PDFs.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - Upload a Jira ticket PDF containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data).
     - Verify that the sensitive information is not exposed in the application's user interface or logs.
     - Attempt to access or download the uploaded PDF file directly (e.g., by guessing the file path).
   - **Expected Result:** The application should properly safeguard sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access to uploaded files.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test with different types of sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers).
     - Test with different levels of user permissions and roles.

3. **Usability Testing**
   - **Description:** Ensure that the user interface and flow for uploading Jira ticket PDFs and generating functional tests are intuitive and user-friendly.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - Recruit a group of representative users (e.g., developers, testers, project managers) to participate in usability testing.
     - Observe and gather feedback from users as they navigate through the process of uploading Jira ticket PDFs and generating functional tests.
     - Identify any areas of confusion, frustration, or inefficiency in the user experience.
   - **Expected Result:** The user interface and flow should be intuitive, and users should be able to complete the tasks with ease and minimal friction.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test with users who have varying levels of technical expertise.
     - Test with users who have different accessibility needs (e.g., visual impairments, motor impairments).

Note: These are just examples, and you may need to add or modify test cases/scenarios based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
